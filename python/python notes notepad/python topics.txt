Demonstrate your skills in Python.
Implement webscraping and use APIs to extract data in Python.
Play the role of a Data Engineer working on a real project to extract, transform and load data using Jupyter notebook and Watson Studio.
==========================
Python for Data Engineering is one of the crucial skills required in this field to create Data Pipelines, set up Statistical Models, and perform a thorough analysis on them
========================
What does a data engineer use Python for?
Python is used mainly for data analysis and pipelines. Data Engineers use Python mainly for data munging such as reshaping, aggregating, joining disparate sources, etc., small-scale ETL, API interaction, and automation.
=================================
Do data engineers use pandas?
Pandas is a great tool for data analysis and engineering. I've been using it for about three years — prior to that, it was a mish-mash of Python libraries and a bit yucky.07-Nov-2019
=====================
Scripting, an alternative to bash shell
Deriving proof of concept before actual development in Java or other more sophisticated languages
Data analysis, manipulation and reporting
Gluing libraries written in different languages, web APIs and any other programs
Rapid prototyping
XML processing
=======================================
 including data cleaning, processing and working on production databases.

Use Cases of Python for Data Engineering
Data Acquisition
Data Manipulation
Data Modelling
Data Surfacing
===================
Lists, Tuples, dictionary, sets. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras. These are the most important and common topics to learn.
=====================

Functions, Packages
Iterators
===========
Generators, Decorators

Working with Regular Expressions
================
Data extraction
Data processing/cleaning (you will be doing this up to 50–60% of the time you’re analysing data)
Data modeling (this is the fun part where you’re applying machine learning algorithms and stuff on training and testing sets)
Data visualization
Presentation of insights learned
==============
Knowing how to use the print statement with different data types and also converting them e.g. strings to integer and integer to strings.
Knowing the difference between local vs global variables and how to use them.
How to read, extract and manipulate Strings character by character.
How to read, extract and manipulate Lists and Dictionaries.
For and While loops, using them with range, list, dictionary and also when/how break the loops.
Boolean, arithmetic and comparison operators
Conditions (if, elif & else)
Functions
Class and objects
These are also the basics
