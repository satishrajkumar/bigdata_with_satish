c,pascal,fortran,cobol
procedure orienred prograaming languages.

pblms in

programmers focus is mainly on
1)how to solve the problem.==print f scan f
2)reusability is very less==everything code has to be developed from scratch.
3)suitable for small projects==programmer looses control on the programme due to high lines of code.cannot debug the code easily.
4)here the programme is artificial.

-----------------------
oops

focus is on data and data manipulation

programming reflects human life.==develop programmes from  human being's
life like objects..this is oops.===ex bike part of our life no fear and no tense you can use it easily.

languages like c++,java,python,.NET ==abject oriented progg languages.

resuability os available here===resuing from other class code i can develop my code.

oops is suitable for bigger and complex projects.-==because of writing classes===class contains data and functions.
-----------------------------------


features of oops 
------------
object oriented programming system.

it is a special methoadolgy ,using which the progg language is developed .


features
---------
1classes and objects.

*An object is anything that exists physically in the real world.

your imagination is not an object ,emotions are not object.

behaviour  ---properties and actions 
angry         red eyes      throw the objects

every bject exibit behaviour which can be understood by its property and actions .

raju =object ===properties (name,age,height,wt) which are represented by variables

actions (talk,walk eat)=====doing calculations ,processing the data 

to represent that action functions are written .

in oops other name of function is methods.

an object contains variables and method .

group of objects having same or coomon  behaviour is called class

a class represents a group or a category of objects exhibiting common behaviou.


eg politicians common behaviour like robbing ,looting money...etc
eg teachers 
eg soldiers
eg businessmen

oops features
-------

a class does not exist physically though they contains variables and methods.

eg persons class (raju,sita,ramu) 


object and class 
------------------------
mysore paak ==object
sweets is class ==sugar,atta,ghee...properties

furniture is a class.

flower class.

colour class.

plan is a class ..house is an object

a class is a plan or a model for creating objects.

an object is an instance of (physical form) of the class.


an object does not exist without a class .

but a class can exist without any objects.



class is mainly used to create an object.


create class #here the memory is not allocated
class person:

          #properties=vars
          #actions=methods

object is created to perform the tasks...and hence the pvm will allocate the memoryblock from the computers ram...

to create an object ...
x=person()===person class object whose name is x==is a variable that stores the memory address of the object.
-----------------------------------------------
__init__==hidden internally created by pvm..
not available outside ...created inside pvm...
mrthod overiding...function running automatically by pvm executing
self default parameter= stores the memory address of the current object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variables and methods 

separate copies of instance variables will be created for every object.
method acting on instance variables is called instance method.

class method
------------
class var== it is a var whose single copy is shared by all the objects.

cls is a default parameter that stores the memory address of the class namespace .

instance namespace ==where the objects are created.

class variables are the car whose singlecopy shared by all objs.

any modifications done to class methods ....modies all objects of a class.

objects are independent to each other .

staticmethod
----------
it will not effect the objects or the class,when any modications are done .




































class 21
----------

inner class or nested clas
---------------------------
class inside another class...
inner class is written to sub group the data and its functionality
obj==  outerobj.innerclass()
   == outerclass().innerclass()
-----------------------------------------
features of oops 
classes and objects
 
encapsulation== 
bundling up of data and methods
a class is an example for encapsulation.

encapsulation is a protective mechanism

advantage is possible to use same names can be used for different classes.
class will protect its own members


abstraction
hiding unnecessory data from the user.
adv is data security
no 100%abstraction in python


inheritance
creating new classes from existing classes such that the new class will inherit all the men=mbers of the existing classes.

why all the members of superclass are available to sub class?

when you create an obj to sub class,it contains a copy of superclass.

we can call the all the methods from sub class

advantage of inheritance?
----------------------------------
developing the code with less time ...hence productivity of programmer is increased.==3 times more code you can deliver in a given spanm of time 

increase the overall productivity of the company and more profits for company.

--------------------------------------
class 22

super() should be used in the sub class.

object is the superclass for all classes in python including for our own classes .

java does not support multiple inheritance.


-------------------------
polymorphism


@static method
def add(*x)=variable length argument

cretaing a duplicate method  or same method  in the sub class as==overifi=ding

when to do method overriding 
when you want whole method along with some addition method then you can refer this method.

javascript object based progg lang
no inheritance.
