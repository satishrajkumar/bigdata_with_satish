===================================
functions

A function can return more than one value. When several values are returned, they are stored
into a tuple and then returned.

It is possible to send a group of strings or numbers in the form of a list to a function and do any
operation inside the function. 

When local variable and global variable have same name, we can use globals() function to retrieve
the global variable value inside the function. Ex: globals()[‘var’]

Functions are first class objects
That means we can use functions exactly as objects.
